## Description

**Reaper Mesh** is a LoRa-based communication firmware built for the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 (SX1262) device. Initially developed for **Reaper Net**, this firmware will soon support dedicated mobile device integration.

The firmware uses a lightweight, serial `AT+` command interface â€” no Protobufs, no complex protocols. It is designed for ease of use and extensibility. Current settings like frequency and device name are static, but future updates will support runtime configurability and private mesh channels.

Out of the box, all messages are **AES-encrypted**. While this initial encryption is device-side, future versions will offload encryption to dedicated cryptographic modules for improved security.

Thanks to built-in message fragmentation and reassembly, payloads of virtually any length can be transmitted. Messages are split, encrypted, and seamlessly reconstructed on the receiving end. For example, a 3KB image was successfully transmitted over LoRa â€” albeit slowly â€” demonstrating the systemâ€™s capability to handle large data.

Currently, the firmware supports only serial communication. However, as noted earlier, future updates will introduce support for a companion mobile app and potentially a self-hosted message server. I built this firmware with simplicity in mind â€” avoiding feature creep and unnecessary bloat. That said, I acknowledge that even a minimalist design like this may still pose a learning curve for some users. Once the core system logic is finalized, I plan to improve usability for broader accessibility.

Regarding mesh networking: the current implementation is single-hop, but full mesh functionality is a top priority for the next major update. Mesh networking is essential â€” and itâ€™s coming, I promise.

**Supported Devices**
Currently there is only one device supported but this can easily be ported to other devices. I would encourage waiting until the project has longer legs. Until then, you can find the device on the official website below. You can pick these up on Amazon as well but make sure it is the real deal and not a clone.

Note: This firmware is its own protocol and will not work to communicate with other LoRa protocals like Meshtatstic or standard LoRa or LoRaWan. You will need two devices with teh same firmware for them to communicate.

## How to use

This firmware provides no user interface to the device currently. Everything is done via Serial communications on Baud rate 115200. Connecting to the device can be done via a USB cable or through serial connections from another MCU.

As the project becomes more stable, I will be adding more ways to take advantage of the communication between nodes.

## Understand Serial Responses

Each response from the device has a simple format it follows. All responses are separated by the character "|". The first index will be LOG,RECV,SEND, or ERR.

**Receiving LOG Example**

LOG responses can be used to hook into or simply display as a log in your application. The give a keyword of what the LOG is for.

-   `LOG|DEVICE_CONNECTED`
-   `LOG|BEACON_SENT`

**Receiving a Beacon Example**

The example below shows a normal message coming in but after decrypting, the content is a beacon ping from another node. They are saying "Hi, I'm Here!"

-   `RECV|FRAG|F305|1/1`
-   `RECV|28C6|BEACON|F305`

**SEND/RECV Example**

Below is an example of sending a message that has 5 fragments followed by a `RECV|ACK_CONFIRM`. The ACK_CONFIRM is a receipt confirmation that a node as received the message.

AT+ command to send a message

-   `AT+MSG=Hello World`

Serial Output

-   `SEND|FRAG|56FA|1/5|TRY=1`
-   `SEND|FRAG|56FA|2/5|TRY=1`
-   `SEND|FRAG|56FA|3/5|TRY=1`
-   `SEND|FRAG|56FA|4/5|TRY=1`
-   `SEND|FRAG|56FA|5/5|TRY=1`
-   `RECV|ACK_CONFIRM|56FA`

NOTE: the RECV|ACK_CONFIRM response as the MSG_ID to let you know which message they confirmed they received.

## Installation

```bash
git https://github.com/justingreerbbi/Reaper-Net/
```

1. I prefer to use VSCode for this along with PlatformIO. If you don't have VSCode, download it and install PlatFormIO in the extensions. Once PlatformIO is installed, simple open a new project and open the directory where you downloaded this code. The system should download all the dependencies (which is not a lot).

2. Plug in your HeltecV3 device and upload and monitor.

3. In the monitor, you can copy and paste any of the example commands and the device will do the rest.

The commands and return in the serial monitor are designed to be software friendly. You can tie in your own GUI and so what you with with the serial data.

All serial responses are structured for sanity. Sections are separated by "|".

1. SEND|FRAG|MSGID=12736|SEQ=1/X|TRY=1 - Lines that start with SEND is a log for you to know that the device is broadcasting a message. This structure allows you to provide a progress bar by parsing the SEQ section. 1/3 means 33%, etc.

2. RECV|ACK_CONFIRM|MSGID - ACK message. The Device received a confirmation that a device has received the message fully.
