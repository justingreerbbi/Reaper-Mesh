## Description

**Reaper Mesh** is a LoRa-based communication firmware built for the Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 (SX1262) device. Initially developed for **Reaper Net**, this firmware will soon support dedicated mobile device integration.

The firmware uses a lightweight, serial `AT+` command interface â€” no Protobufs, no complex protocols. It is designed for ease of use and extensibility. Current settings like frequency and device name are static, but future updates will support runtime configurability and private mesh channels.

Out of the box, all messages are **AES-encrypted**. While this initial encryption is device-side, future versions will offload encryption to dedicated cryptographic modules for improved security.

Thanks to message fragmentation and reassembly, messages of virtually any length can be transmitted. Payloads are split, encrypted, and reassembled seamlessly. For example, a 3KB image was successfully sent over LoRa â€” albeit slowly â€” proving this firmware's support for large data transfers.
